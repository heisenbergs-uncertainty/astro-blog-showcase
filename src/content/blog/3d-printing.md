I've recently started exploring the world of **3D printing**. As a software engineer, moving from bits to atoms is an exciting challenge.

## The Setup

I picked up a Prusa Mk4 kit because I wanted to understand the machine inside out. The assembly took a weekend, but it was worth it.

## Designing Functional Parts

My first project was a custom mount for my headphones. I used **Fusion 360** to design the part.

```javascript
// Software mindset applying to hardware
const layers = [];
while (print.height < target.height) {
    layers.push(new Layer());
}
```

It's fascinating how parametric design feels like coding.
