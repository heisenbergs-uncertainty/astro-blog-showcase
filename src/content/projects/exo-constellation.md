## Overview

This project was built to showcase my work as a software engineer. I wanted something fast, simple, but visually premium.

## Tech Stack

- **Astro**: For static site generation and performance.
- **Bulma**: For the CSS framework, customized with SASS.
- **Playwright**: For end-to-end testing.

## Challenges

Getting the glassmorphism effect right with Bulma required some custom SASS overrides, but the result is a clean, modern aesthetic.
